# Audio Book Creator

Welcome to the Audio Book Creator repository! This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to create and manage audio books.

This project is simply proof of concept but you are welcome to use it, edit it, send PR's, and comment.

## Features

- Compiles MP# files into a audio book format.

## Installation

mp4v2 is required. The best way I found to install mp4v2 if using choco on Windows or Brew on OSX.

Windows
```
choco install mp4v2
```

OSX
```
brew install mp4v2
```

## Usage

Using the script is simple at the moment. Place the MP3 files in the same directory and run the script. The output will be a audiobook.m4b file containing all the MP3 files.
